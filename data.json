        { "text": "Which is why many children can learn and [master] multiple languages. Yet the prefrontal cortex, a brain region [responsible] for cognitive control and inhibition, is slower to develop.", "start": 182, "end": 193 },
        { "text": "As a result, some young children may struggle with [strategic] games, such as chess or checkers, which require constant [concentration], planning, and abstract thought.", "start": 193, "end": 204 },

        { "text": "Simultaneously, deep inside the brain, regions that are important in [motivation] and reward are developing even faster, driving teenagers to be [curious] and adventurous learners.", "start": 277, "end": 289 },
        { "text": "In many ways, you can think of the teenager as a jack-of-all-trades, with brains [wired] to seek out new [experiences] and learn quickly.", "start": 289, "end": 303 },
